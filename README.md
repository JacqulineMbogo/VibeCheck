Users can create and organize journal entries by category and access a summarized view of their reflections for easy tracking and insights.


**Technology Stack ðŸš€**

- **Frontend & Routing:** Developed with **Next.js**, utilizing the new file-based App Router and supporting both **server and client components** for optimized performance.  
- **Server-Side Logic:** Implements **Server Actions** to efficiently handle data processing and interactions directly on the server.  
- **Programming Language:** Written in **TypeScript** to ensure type safety, maintainability, and scalability across both frontend and backend layers.  
- **Database:** Uses **PostgreSQL**, hosted on **Neon**, a cloud-native platform providing scalable and secure database solutions.  
- **ORM:** Incorporates **Drizzle ORM**, a type-safe and developer-friendly ORM that simplifies database operations while maintaining flexibility.  
- **Authentication:** Implements **Clerk Authentication** for secure and seamless user authentication, including social logins and session management.  
- **Validation:** Utilizes **Zod** for schema validation, ensuring data integrity and preventing invalid inputs at both the API and client levels.  
- **UI & Styling:** Designed with **Shadcn UI** for customizable components and **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first framework for efficient and consistent styling.  

**Project Setup**

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# **System Architecture Design**

### **1. Architecture Overview**  
The app will use a modern full-stack architecture with **Next.js** for both the frontend and backend, leveraging its API routes feature to minimize complexity.

---

### **2. Data Model**  
ðŸ“Œ **#TODO:** *Add ERD Image Here*  

---

### **3. Key Technical Decisions**  

#### **1. Authentication Strategy: Clerk Integration**  
To streamline user management, **Clerk** has been chosen as the authentication solution. Given the tight project timeline, outsourcing this functionality was the most practical option, allowing for faster implementation while maintaining high-quality, secure user authentication.  

Key reasons for this decision:  
- **Quick Implementation**: Pre-built authentication components reduce setup time from days or weeks to just a few hours.  
- **Comprehensive Features**: Includes a complete authentication stack (sign-up, login, multi-factor authentication (MFA), social login).  
- **Security Compliance**: Clerk automatically handles best practices like password hashing, account recovery flows, and protection against common vulnerabilities.  
- **User Management Dashboard**: An admin interface allows non-technical team members to manage users, reset passwords, and handle support requests.  
- **Scalability**: Built to scale with the applicationâ€™s growth without major architectural changes.  
- **API Flexibility**: Customizable authentication flows through Clerk's API-first approach.  
- **Modern Integration**: Seamless support for frameworks like Next.js, React, and Vue.  

---

#### **2. Database Choice**  
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for its reliability, advanced features, and ability to handle complex queries for summary analytics.

---

### **4. Scaling Considerations**  
To support future growth and scale to **1M+ users**, the following scaling strategies can be considered:  
- **Database Sharding**: By `user_id` to enable horizontal scaling.  
- **Caching Layer**: Use **Redis** for frequently accessed queries.  
- **Serverless Functions**: Migrate API routes to serverless functions for scalability and cost efficiency.  
- **CDN Integration**: For static assets to reduce load times.  
- **Read Replicas**: Add read replicas to optimize performance for analytics queries.

---

### **5. Testing Strategy**  
To ensure the system's reliability, the following testing strategies have been implemented:  
- **Unit Tests**: Cover core business logic.  
- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints.  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: For critical user flows.  
- **Test Coverage Goal**: Achieve at least **80% test coverage**.

---

### **6. Implementation Plan**  

#### **Phase 1: Core Functionality**  
- User authentication  
- Basic CRUD functionality for journal entries  
- Simple categorization  

#### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**  
- Improved UI/UX  
- Entry analytics and summaries  
- Advanced categorization  

#### **Phase 3: Optional AI Features**  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Auto-categorization  
- Content insights
